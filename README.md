# CarND-Path-Planning-Project
Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program
   
### Simulator.
You can download the Term3 Simulator which contains the Path Planning Project from the [releases tab (https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases/tag/T3_v1.2).  

To run the simulator on Mac/Linux, first make the binary file executable with the following command:
```shell
sudo chmod u+x {simulator_file_name}
```


### Goals
In this project your goal is to safely navigate around a virtual highway with other traffic that is driving +-10 MPH of the 50 MPH speed limit. You will be provided the car's localization and sensor fusion data, there is also a sparse map list of waypoints around the highway. The car should try to go as close as possible to the 50 MPH speed limit, which means passing slower traffic when possible, note that other cars will try to change lanes too. The car should avoid hitting other cars at all cost as well as driving inside of the marked road lanes at all times, unless going from one lane to another. The car should be able to make one complete loop around the 6946m highway. Since the car is trying to go 50 MPH, it should take a little over 5 minutes to complete 1 loop. Also the car should not experience total acceleration over 10 m/s^2 and jerk that is greater than 10 m/s^3.

#### The map of the highway is in data/highway_map.txt
Each waypoint in the list contains  [x,y,s,dx,dy] values. x and y are the waypoint's map coordinate position, the s value is the distance along the road to get to that waypoint in meters, the dx and dy values define the unit normal vector pointing outward of the highway loop.

The highway's waypoints loop around so the frenet s value, distance along the road, goes from 0 to 6945.554.

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./path_planning`.

Here is the data provided from the Simulator to the C++ Program

#### Main car's localization Data (No Noise)

["x"] The car's x position in map coordinates

["y"] The car's y position in map coordinates

["s"] The car's s position in frenet coordinates

["d"] The car's d position in frenet coordinates

["yaw"] The car's yaw angle in the map

["speed"] The car's speed in MPH

#### Previous path data given to the Planner

//Note: Return the previous list but with processed points removed, can be a nice tool to show how far along
the path has processed since last time. 

["previous_path_x"] The previous list of x points previously given to the simulator

["previous_path_y"] The previous list of y points previously given to the simulator

#### Previous path's end s and d values 

["end_path_s"] The previous list's last point's frenet s value

["end_path_d"] The previous list's last point's frenet d value

#### Sensor Fusion Data, a list of all other car's attributes on the same side of the road. (No Noise)

["sensor_fusion"] A 2d vector of cars and then that car's [car's unique ID, car's x position in map coordinates, car's y position in map coordinates, car's x velocity in m/s, car's y velocity in m/s, car's s position in frenet coordinates, car's d position in frenet coordinates. 

## Details

1. The car uses a perfect controller and will visit every (x,y) point it recieves in the list every .02 seconds. The units for the (x,y) points are in meters and the spacing of the points determines the speed of the car. The vector going from a point to the next point in the list dictates the angle of the car. Acceleration both in the tangential and normal directions is measured along with the jerk, the rate of change of total Acceleration. The (x,y) point paths that the planner recieves should not have a total acceleration that goes over 10 m/s^2, also the jerk should not go over 50 m/s^3. (NOTE: As this is BETA, these requirements might change. Also currently jerk is over a .02 second interval, it would probably be better to average total acceleration over 1 second and measure jerk from that.

2. There will be some latency between the simulator running and the path planner returning a path, with optimized code usually its not very long maybe just 1-3 time steps. During this delay the simulator will continue using points that it was last given, because of this its a good idea to store the last points you have used so you can have a smooth transition. previous_path_x, and previous_path_y can be helpful for this transition since they show the last points given to the simulator controller with the processed points already removed. You would either return a path that extends this previous path or make sure to create a new path that has a smooth transition with this last path.

## Model Documentation

The path planning logic was developed in the main.cpp file. It uses information from other cars measured information to decide the require behavior and execute the path using a spline.  The path=planing was done in frenet coordinate by transforming from X-Y, do the calculation and transforming back to X-Y.

### Default Behavior
By default, the car maintains its lane and travels with a constant speed of 49.5 mph. This means in the case of empty highway, a car will drive with max speed without changing lane.

### Measurements to other cars
To decide if the car should maintain its lane or change the lane, it needs to know its distance to nearby cars in the same lane or other lanes. This is developed in lines from 160 to 220 of main.cpp. It goes through all sensor fusion information and calculates the followings:
* Distance to the closest car in the front of our car in the same lane 
* Speed of the closest car in the front of our car in the same lane  
* Distance to the closest car in the front of our car in right and left lane 
* Distance to the closest car in the rear of our car in right and left lane 
* Speed of the closest car in the front of our car in right and left lane 
* Speed of the closest car in the rear of our car in right and left lane 


### Speed control
To avoid collision site front car in the same lane, car will scan up to 40[m] in front of it, and if there is any car moving slower, "too_close" status was set to true in line 172. when there is another car too close to our car in the same lane, we reduce the speed of the car in line 263. Otherwise, we increase the speed of the car in line 329. 

### Matching Speed for Changing lane
In the case that there is another car too close to our car in the same lane, the logic checks if changing lane to left or right is possible. The first check is to check matching speed for changing lane. Matching speed is valid if our car speed is faster than the rear car but slower than the car in front in the other lane. Obviously, these checks become less important where there is enough distance between our car and other cars in the other lane. The details of these conditions are specified in lines  244 to 258.

### Check clearance or changing lane
The other condition for changing lane is if our car has enough distance and time to change the lane. The threshold to change the lane set to 12 [m]. In this case, logic check if the car distance to the closest car in the front or rear is great than 12[m]. In addition to distance, In logic, I check if there is enough time for changing the lane. The car change lane is calculated by assuming it takes 4 [m] to change lane divided by speed plus 2 [sec] for the acceleration-deceleration part. Also, the time the rear car in other lane needs to reach our car is simply calculated by dividing the gap between our car and the rear car by the rear car's speed. Clearance checks for changing lane is coded in lines in 274 to 281. 

### Decide if to change lane to the right or left
In the case that both right and left lanes are clear, the path-planing logic will decide to change lane to the one that the front car has a longer distance to our car in lies 283 to 319. 

### Spline for Path-planning
As recommended in the Q&A session, I used spline with 5 anchor points for path planning. For better accuracy in keep the lane, I used 20, 40 and 100 m for spline anchor pints. However, for a better lane changing approach, I used 40, 60 and 120 [m] anchors. 

## Tips

A really helpful resource for doing this project and creating smooth trajectories was using http://kluge.in-chemnitz.de/opensource/spline/, the spline function is in a single hearder file is really easy to use.

## Editor Settings

We've purposefully kept editor configuration files out of this repo in order to
keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!


## Call for IDE Profiles Pull Requests

Help your fellow students!

We decided to create Makefiles with cmake to keep this project as platform
agnostic as possible. Similarly, we omitted IDE profiles in order to ensure
that students don't feel pressured to use one IDE or another.

However! I'd love to help people get up and running with their IDEs of choice.
If you've created a profile for an IDE that you think other students would
appreciate, we'd love to have you add the requisite profile files and
instructions to ide_profiles/. For example if you wanted to add a VS Code
profile, you'd add:

* /ide_profiles/vscode/.vscode
* /ide_profiles/vscode/README.md

The README should explain what the profile does, how to take advantage of it,
and how to install it.

Frankly, I've never been involved in a project with multiple IDE profiles
before. I believe the best way to handle this would be to keep them out of the
repo root to avoid clutter. My expectation is that most profiles will include
instructions to copy files to a new location to get picked up by the IDE, but
that's just a guess.

One last note here: regardless of the IDE used, every submitted project must
still be compilable with cmake and make./
